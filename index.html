Aiming to grasp an aspect of the human view over animals, it researches the concept of captivation, and question the tendency of personification and objectification of non-human bodies. </span></a>

            <a class="thesisWrapper feminism power resistance material" href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-23-lara-dautun/" target="_blank"><span class="thesisAuthor"> ▮ Lara Dautun</span> • <span class="thesisTitle">Two Stories of Feminist Publishing</span> • <span class="thesisDescription">The printed production of second-wave feminism constitutes a rich and diverse mass of periodicals, pamphlets, books and ephemera offering a vast reservoir of ideas and approaches for more sustainable and inclusive publishing practices. This thesis attempts to bring them to light, by searching for their traces in the Dutch archives (Atria & ILHIA), mapping their networks, and listening to the voices and stories of the women who shaped such a revolutionary movement. </span></a>

My carrier bag moves from and beyond the garden, unnaming, the wild, snail intimacy, glitch, philosophy’s big boys (Plato, Descartes), and vulnerability: it is my undertaking at constructing a layered, non–linear understanding of all these interrelated concepts and phenomena, without forcing them into one single narrative.</span></a>

Dreams, imagination, play, and magic. The combination of the unconscious, conscious, and uncertainty glide us into a world where fantasy becomes reality.</span></a>

            <a class="thesisWrapper digital human" href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-23-elina-ersdorf/" target="_blank"><span class="thesisAuthor"> ▮ Elina Ersdorf</span> • <span class="thesisTitle">I GOT CONSUMED BY A CONTENT I CONSUME</span> • <span class="thesisDescription">Social media and digital tools have made it easier than ever to capture and share our personal experiences, often leading to a sense of social currency and FOMO that encourages us to document and curate our lives, potentially obscuring our true identities. Our faith in what seems to be an infinite storage has led us to a culture of memories hoarding, which overabundance causes them to lose their value due to becoming disorganized clutter and contextless content. </span></a>

Specifically looking at a trip through Africa in the 70s, and adventures on a sailboat called Drífa from 1980 until 1992.</span></a>

This stands in conflict with the aspects of the slower processes which move according to autonomous values. Therefore, I am to question and contribute to the shift of liberating ourselves from the boundaries of time that modern social constructs maintain upon us. </span></a>

In the past, carpets would be woven in almost every household but now only few continue this tradition. In this essay I will explore the changing nature of traditional Aegean village life, particularly for that of women.</span></a>

Couple of engineers, in the heart of Moscow, envisioned a new way to cultivate giant hogweed as agricultural sillage. Their grand plan was to feed the cows and elevate the dairy industry in collective farms scattered throughout the Soviet Union. Yet, the decision makers were far removed from the actual farms, soil, and environments that this decision would affect. Unfortunately, none of the individuals responsible for executing these centralised design decisions realized the potential consequences, or chose to ignore them entirely.</span></a>

Until the Middle Ages, the chair belonged to a ruler or an authority, and everyone could sit in a comfortable chair with a backrest after the Industrial Revolution when mass production became possible. We can find chairs everywhere we feel the irresistible urge to sit down.</span></a>

By researching ambiguous loss, NDE and myth alongside with weaving in personal and family stories of love, loss and grief, I aim to add depth and nuance to this often-dismissed concept and wish to propose it as a ritual or practice that can help people to confront and overcome different kinds of loss.</span></a>

A partly observational but highly personal story of my own experiences of the garden, herbaria and in general the natural environment, humanity and technology. Written during the hibernation of the garden, this is a text which longs for the rebirth of nature in a digital realm and the reconnection with the physical and spiritual world.</span></a>

            <a class="thesisWrapper feminism digital power bodies" href="https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-23-chiara-nowak/" target="_blank"><span class="thesisAuthor"> ▮ Chiara Nowak</span> • <span class="thesisTitle">Feminist-Tech Design: Narratives of Empowerment</span> • <span class="thesisDescription">The thesis posits that the contraceptive pill has transitioned from a symbol of empowerment to a tool of control, which is being further intensified by the emergence of Female Health Technologies (Femtech). It further argues that Femtech needs to be reimagined as a truly feminist technology, given its current design which perpetuates systems of power and control over the female body.</span></a>

Extreme forms of body modification represent a new form of human expression and evolution in the post-humanism paradigm. Society is redefining what it means to be human, animal, and machine, and the boundaries between them are becoming blurred. Iconic cases of extreme body modification and examples from art and film illustrate how these practices reflect a world in transition.</span></a>

But salt also has a cultural significance, connecting us to our past. Through historical sources, fables, cultural folktales, and personal memories, we can explore how salt has been used to preserve food and how it has played a role in our cultural heritage. Let me take you through my path of salt.</span></a>

And how can it be used as a means to reject past/present forms of oppression? As an act of resistance against cultural endangerment? Using the Spanish Civil War as point of departure, this thesis aims to shed some light on the nuances of social and infrastructural processes of decay that happen in war torn territories, touching upon the endangerment of cultural heritage and the continuous perpetuation of violence. </span></a>

                    I tried to use the mushroom as a research method and a bedrock for how I would like to investigate each subtheme, while peeling off each layer of the mushroom as we go down. </span></a>

In this text I question the ways in which they continue to shape Jamaica today, what collective memory they represent and whether there is a way to subvert the meanings they carry.</span></a>

Handing nutritious food to needy strangers, even if one desires the food, is a uniquely human form of altruistic behaviour.</span></a>

To make this quest tangible, i employ and build upon the ever-expanding definition of the ornament, not purely as a graphic gesture, but mostly as an expression — a tool for communication and fulfilment.</span></a>
